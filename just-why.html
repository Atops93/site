</header><h2>If you are thinking of judging just piss off. I also like to warn those that don't like bad language to just fuck off because this ain't the place for you buddy.</h2>
</header><h2>I dont see the point in ricing your unixporn ah websites along with shitty frameworks & yet you do all of that just so it looks "NICER!!!" like bro most motherfuckers are just making a personal site, not a god damn business website. This site contains some simple fucking html files THAT YOU CAN STILL READ CANT YOU MATE? However, if you are one of those motherfuckers who think a good looking site is needed, just piss off. Instead a nice solution is to fucking cut that thought & keep it <mark>minimal.</mark> I dont think a single human on this earth gives a rats ass to visit the site & stare at it for decades. You're the only person in humanity who actually gives a fuck for your made website. If the site is readable & the shitty user knows how to use it then there is no fucking issue is there?</h2>

</header><h2>Here are listed reasons why you dont need a unixporn looking ah site, and a plain site for personal use just works as good if not better than a "COOL" one.</h2>

<ul><li>This website is just a few files or so, its lightweight, builds fast, loads fast.</li>
<ul><li>This site can be loaded on all your fucking devices.</li>
