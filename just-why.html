</header><h2>If you are thinking of judging just piss off. I also like to warn those that dont like bad language to just fuck off because this aint the place for you buddy.</h2>
</header><h2>I dont see the point in ricing your unixporn ah websites with shitty along with shitty frameworks and yet you do all of that just so it looks "NICER!!!" like bro most motherfuckers are just making a personal site, not a god damn business website... all this site is made of is a simple fucking html file THAT YOU CAN STILL READ CANT YOU MATE... Instead a nice solution is to fucking cut that thought & keep it <mark>minimal.</mark> I dont think a single human on this earth gives a rats ass to visit the site & stare at it for decades, your the only person proud of your work. If the site is readable & the shitty user knows how to use it then there is no fucking issue is there?</h2>

</header><h2>Here are listed reasons why you dont need a unixporn looking site and a plain site for personal use just works as good if not better than a "COOL" one.</h2>

<ul><li>This website is just a few files or so, its lightweight, builds fast, loads fast.</li>
<ul><li>This site can be loaded on all your fucking devices.</li>
