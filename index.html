</header><h2>Now I dont see the point in ricing you're unixporn ah websites with shitty bloated frameworks and yet you do all of that just so it looks "NICER!!!" like bro... all this site is made of is a simple fucking html file... Instead a nice solution is to fucking cut that thought & keep it <mark>minimal.</mark> I dont think a single human will go to you're site & stare at it for decades. If the site is readable & the shitty user knows how to use it then theres no issue is there?</h2>
